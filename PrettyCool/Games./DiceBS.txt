I made this when I was like 12 or something. I found it on a piece of paper with horrible handwriting.

Each player receives the same number of dice
Best with 3 players or more
Players Roll the Dice, peek at their own dice
(Do whatever you want to figure out who goes first)

The Name of the Game is to "Bluff" about what everyone's Dice are (variation could be everyone writes down multiple numbers from 1-6)

A "bluff" would be something like "there are at least 3 threes" which is possible for them to know if they have all threes.

The Next Player needs to call a bluff of "higher" power

Basically multiply the numbers together to get the power rating. "3 threes" is power 9 so the bluff "there are 10 ones" is stronger

You can combine bluffs to add together the power "there are at least 2 threes and at least 4 ones" is also power 10

Anyone can accuse the bluffer.
Players can choose a side or stay neutral.
Everyone reveals their numbers and the latest bluff is checked.
