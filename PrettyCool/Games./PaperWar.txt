I made this in middle school with a friend
Its a great paper based game
It's technically 1 dimensional but its great to visualize on a sheet of looseleaf paper

One Person is X and the other is O
Separate the paper into 3 sections 5 or more lines for each "territory" and the rest for the central section
The Topmost and Bottommost Sections are the Territories (Peaceful), the Central Section is the Fight Zone
While in a territory you are invulnerable (enemy or not) but you also cannot attack while in a territory
(A rule of war is that it's uncool to kill civilians so it totally makes sense XD)
The goal is to get 3 of your dots behind enemy lines at the same time
Or to kill all of the opponents dots

Pro Tip:
	Once you are down to 1 or 2 dots, it is possible to get the enemy down to 1 or 2 dots as well (Hard but possible)
	If that happens and all pieces get safely behind a territory (or it is obvious that no more fighting will occur),
	The Person with the most total HP win. Is same amount of HP ... wow. Both players worked really hard. Congrats!



There are 3 types of dots to use

Tanks: 20HP 4MovementUnits
	grenade: -5HP 4MU 2RadiusUnits (Can hit up to 2 enemies)
	gun: -2HP 6MU 0RU (Hits everyone on chosen line)

Sprinters: 15HP 5MU
	knife: -100HP 0MU 0RU land on line to insta-kill 1 enemy on that line (cannot hurt tank)
	gun: (same as tank except 5MU)

Regulars: 12HP 3MU (weapons are same as sprinters)

knife note: if you land on a line with 2 enemies, choose one to kill but you will die in the process
knife note 2: they still work even when in a peaceful zone . watch out


The Standard Game is 2 Tanks, 3 Sprinters and 5 Regulars. but it can be adjusted
In the beginning, you place ur dots anywhere you want in your territory
There must be at least 1 dot on every line of territory



Turns:
All dots can either move OR use a weapon (with the exception of knife which is a movement based weapon)
Can only move up to 50% of ur dots (if 3 dots on board can only move 1 dot)
Any dot that hasn't moved, can shoot.
These operations can be done in any order as long as you're able to keep track of it
