I made this when I was like 12 or something. I found it on a piece of paper with horrible handwriting.

Color - Amount of Moves - Power
White  - 1 - Kill 4 Pieces
Yellow - 2 - Freeze 4 Pieces
Green  - 3 - Revive 2 (Placed Anywhere not occupied or on Star)
Blue   - 4 - Move 3 of any piece (yours or opponent)
Purple - 5 - Freeze 2 Pieces
Red    - 6 - Unfreeze 3 Pieces

• When reaching the Star Space, it activates the piece's power
• You can't use the same Star Corner Twice in a row; once you use the power of one star, you must use the other corner
• Examples
	P1: TopRight, P2: BottomLeft, P1: BottomLeft, P2: TopRight (√ valid)
	P1: TopRight, P2: BottomLeft, P1: TopRight (X invalid)

3-Dice Turn-Based Game!

Roll The Dice
You may Re-roll any pair of Doubles if you so choose
Any two can be added or subtracted (modulo 6) (but only positive modulos!)
	Examples:
	2 and 5 -> 3 or 1 (aka 7)
	5 and 5 -> 4 (aka 10)

When Numbers have been Created you may move corresponding piece
	Whites can only move 1 square at a time
	Reds can move up to 6 Squares!!
	All pieces can "jump" over pieces
	If it ends up at a location occupied by another piece, it "kills" that piece (including your own but why would u do that)

Pro Tips:
You can move the same piece twice in same turn if you get lucky and want to
	a double 5 will let you move the Purple enough spaces to get to the star most likely.
	triple 5 is enough to go from star to opposite star wow!
	1 5 6 can be converted into a double 5 by subtracting the 6 and 1
