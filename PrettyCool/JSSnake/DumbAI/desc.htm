This is my old AI. Basically I told it "Follow your tail and you'll never get stuck" "But like ... kinda at least try to get the food usually please?" "But also mostly try to fill in space" Turns out telling a computer those things is really hard. It gets stuck in loops a lot depending on where the food randomly lands.
