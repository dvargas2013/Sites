I made the Hamilton Cycle out of a fever dream that said I can have a condition on my snake that says instead of following its tail all the time just keep in mind a path to fill in the whole board (Hamiltonian Cycle)<br>The thing is that that's 100% enough to win. Just keep the snake going in the same path forever and as long as it goes on each square it'll win eventually.<br>But that felt like cheating so I started researching path rotations while keeping the condition that it needs to be a Hamiltonian Cycle. So it adjusts the path according to the food when it deems it safe to adjust the path.
