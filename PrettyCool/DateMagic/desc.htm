I figured out a cool property about adding stuff one day while doing numerology. Thought I'd demonstrate it.<br>Basically no matter how you add up digits as long as you're left with a single digit at the end. It'll be the same number.<br>(The numbers have a constant modulo 9 sum in each step, if you know math words)
